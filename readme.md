# Deploy storj's gateway-st fly.io
The above config can be used to deploy gateway-st to fly.io.

The s3 credentials needs to be generated by the deployer and passed down as secrets.

## Steps
- Create fly app
```bash
fly apps create storj-gateway
```
- Create an access grant from [storj's console](https://storj.dev/learn/tutorials/quickstart-uplink-cli/uploading-your-first-object/create-first-access-grant)
- Generate 2 random strings to be used as creds
```bash
gpg --gen-random 1 16 | hexdump -v -e '/1 "%02x"'
```
- Add them as following secret variables:
```
STORJ_ACCESS=<access_grant>
STORJ_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=<generated_random_string>
STORJ_MINIO_SECRET_KEY=<generated_random_string>
```
- Deploy
```bash
fly deploy
```
- Optionally, scale as needed
```bash
fly scale <count> --region <regions>
```
